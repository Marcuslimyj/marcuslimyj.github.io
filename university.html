    <p>Wanting to take full oppurtunities of being in Miami and to explore a culture which was different from mine, I sought out two organizations. The first one I joint, was COISO (Council of International Students and Organisation) and the Greek social fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi.</p>

<p>COISO is an organisation that represented the International student population on campus through raising awareness on different cultures and intergrating different international cultures to campus. COISO has been known for hosting a week long cultural festival known as International Week. In recent years, it has become one of the biggest events on campus.</p>
  <p>In March 2014, I was elected to be Vice-President of COISO after organising numerous events such as Asia Night during International Week, where for a whole day COISO showed the University of Miami the Asian culture, from food to performances to cultural activities.</p>
